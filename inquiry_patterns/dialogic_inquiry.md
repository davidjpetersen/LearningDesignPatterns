# Dialogic Inquiry

Knowledge emerges through dialogue, peer challenge and argumentation.

## Context
Seminars emphasizing discussion and collaborative meaning-making.

## Problem
Learners may not develop reasoning skills without engaging others in sustained dialogue.

## Forces
- Tension between advocacy of one's ideas and openness to others
- Need for a safe environment to voice differing views

## Solution
Structure conversations that encourage questioning and critique:
1. Exchange perspectives and questions
2. Critically probe ideas
3. Build shared understanding

## Resulting Context
Participants develop metacognition, empathy and civic reasoning.

## Examples
Socratic seminars, discussion-based humanities, teacher education
