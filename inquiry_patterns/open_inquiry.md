# Open Inquiry

Students generate their own questions, design investigations and communicate findings independently.

## Context
Advanced courses or honors programs emphasizing independent research.

## Problem
Learners may not have opportunities to pursue self-directed investigations.

## Forces
- Balancing freedom with available resources and expertise
- Need for mentorship without dictating direction

## Solution
Support students in full-cycle inquiry:
1. Students pose inquiry questions
2. Plan and conduct the investigation
3. Share findings and reflect

## Resulting Context
Students develop research identity and creative confidence.

## Examples
Capstones, independent research, honors seminars
