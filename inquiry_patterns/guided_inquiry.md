# Guided Inquiry

Instructor poses the question, but students design the method for investigating and interpreting results.

## Context
Transitional steps between structured labs and fully open inquiry.

## Problem
Learners may rely on teacher-provided procedures rather than developing their own investigative plans.

## Forces
- Balancing student autonomy with enough scaffolding
- Ensuring data collection is feasible

## Solution
Provide the guiding question while students create the approach:
1. Instructor provides question
2. Students design investigation method
3. Collect and interpret data

## Resulting Context
Students build confidence in designing methods and drawing conclusions.

## Examples
Laboratory-based courses, public health, sociology
