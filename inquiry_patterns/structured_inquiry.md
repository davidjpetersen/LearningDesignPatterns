# Structured Inquiry

Instructor supplies both the driving question and the procedure. Students collect data and draw conclusions within that framework.

## Context
Beginning research experiences or early lab courses.

## Problem
Novice learners need heavy guidance to practice inquiry skills safely and correctly.

## Forces
- Balancing structure with opportunities to analyze
- Risk of rote following without reflection

## Solution
Provide the question and method while prompting students to interpret results:
1. Instructor provides question and procedure
2. Students gather data
3. Analyze findings and conclude

## Resulting Context
Learners gain confidence in basic inquiry processes before tackling open formats.

## Examples
Introductory STEM courses, research skills bootcamps
