# Comparative Inquiry

Learners explore multiple perspectives or datasets to evaluate competing claims.

## Context
Courses examining controversies or contrasting theories.

## Problem
Students often analyze single sources, missing deeper understanding from comparison.

## Forces

- Cognitive bias toward confirming existing beliefs

## Solution
Guide learners to compare and synthesize:
1. Identify viewpoints or data sets
2. Analyze similarities and differences
3. Synthesize findings to evaluate claims

## Resulting Context
Learners weigh evidence more critically and see nuances in arguments.

## Examples
