# LearningDesignPatterns

This repository collects reusable patterns for instructional design. To create
new patterns, start from the template below:

## Pattern Categories

The patterns collected here group into five overarching modes of instructional organization:

1. **Case Patterns** – Narrative scenarios that develop decision-making and critical thinking. [See case-based subpatterns](case_patterns/README.md) such as Decision, Evaluation, Problem-Diagnosis, Narrative, Outlier, Role-Play and Longitudinal cases. These are well suited to ethics, law, leadership, healthcare and business courses.
2. **Problem Patterns** – Problem‑based learning challenges where students investigate ill‑structured problems, test hypotheses and iterate on solutions. These fit STEM fields, analytics, diagnostics and engineering.
3. **Practice Patterns** – Structured repetition to build fluency, from guided to independent work, drawing on techniques like distributed or deliberate practice. Common in quantitative disciplines.
4. **Design Patterns** – Project-based approaches that have learners prototype and iterate on artifacts through milestone-driven cycles such as design thinking. [See design-based subpatterns](design_patterns/README.md) including Challenge Briefs, Design Sprints, Concept-to-Product Studios, Human-Centered Redesigns and Design Critique Cycles. Useful for instructional design, IT, education and business innovation.
5. **Inquiry Patterns** – Research or simulation driven activities encouraging evidence‑based reasoning. Works well in social sciences, health, psychology, statistics and finance.

These categories can be mixed and matched at different levels—from full courses to smaller modules—and align with UbD and UDL principles.
