# Reflective Practice

Students analyze their own experiences to extract lessons and plan improvements, linking action to theory.

## Context
Any experiential setting where learners can review performance.

## Problem
Without reflection, mistakes repeat and learning remains superficial.

## Forces
- Tension between action and analysis
- Emotional barriers to honest self-assessment

## Solution
Integrate reflection before, during and after practice:
1. Complete a task or experience
2. Respond to guiding reflection prompts
3. Compare performance to standards
4. Identify adjustments for next time
5. Share or document reflections

## Resulting Context
Learners refine strategies and connect theory to practice.

## Examples
Fieldwork logs, design journals, "lessons learned" reports
