# Procedural & Perceptual Practice

Students repeatedly perform tasks or analyze examples to internalize procedures and recognize patterns quickly.

## Context
Settings that demand automaticity or pattern recognition.

## Problem
Novices struggle to apply procedures fluently without repetitive practice.

## Forces
- Desire for efficient mastery
- Risk of boredom or shallow repetition

## Solution
Provide structured drills and varied examples:
1. Break the skill into parts
2. Provide repeated drills or worked examples
3. Offer timely feedback
4. Mix examples to improve discrimination
5. Increase complexity as fluency grows

## Resulting Context
Learners achieve rapid recall and accurate pattern recognition.

## Examples
Laboratories, simulations, homework drills, diagnostic recognition tasks
