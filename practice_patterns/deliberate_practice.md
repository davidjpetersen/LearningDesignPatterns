# Deliberate Practice

Highly focused practice sessions target specific subskills with immediate feedback and clear goals.

## Context
Skill-building environments requiring rapid improvement.

## Problem
Learners may plateau without targeted practice and actionable feedback.

## Forces
- Limited time to master complex tasks
- Need for frequent, high-quality feedback

## Solution
Implement a cycle of deliberate practice:
1. Set a precise performance objective
2. Practice the subskill intensively
3. Receive expert or automated feedback
4. Reflect and adjust approach
5. Repeat with gradually harder tasks

## Resulting Context
Continuous improvement leads to measurable gains in performance.

## Examples
Advanced labs, clinical rotations, writing workshops, music or performance training
