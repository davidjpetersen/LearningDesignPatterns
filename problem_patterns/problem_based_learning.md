# Problem-Based Learning

Learners investigate an authentic problem and apply new knowledge to create and justify solutions. Teams collaborate while a facilitator guides inquiry and reflection.

## Structure
1. Introduce a real or simulated problem scenario
2. Brainstorm what is known and unknown
3. Conduct research or mini-lessons on demand
4. Develop and test possible solutions
5. Present outcomes and reflect on the process

## Problem Types
- **Well-Structured:** clear goals and single correct answer
- **Ill-Structured:** ambiguous data with multiple viable approaches
- **Wicked:** complex issues with no final solution and many stakeholders

## Use Cases
Health sciences, engineering design, teacher education, humanities projects
