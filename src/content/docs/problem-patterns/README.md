These patterns structure inquiry around open-ended problems. They emphasize collaboration, facilitation and reflection so students connect concepts to practice.

## Design Principles
- Present realistic problems that spark curiosity.
- Scaffold investigation with guiding questions and milestones.
- Offer multiple ways for students to engage and respond.

## Sequencing and Integration
- Begin with smaller, well-structured problems then progress toward ill-structured or wicked challenges.
- Revisit problems from new perspectives to deepen understanding.

## Online and Hybrid Tips
- Use collaborative documents and discussion boards to coordinate group work.
- Provide timely facilitator feedback through check-ins or virtual office hours.
