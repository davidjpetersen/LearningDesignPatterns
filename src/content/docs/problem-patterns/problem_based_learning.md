---

Learners investigate an authentic problem and apply new knowledge to create and justify solutions. Teams collaborate while a facilitator guides inquiry and reflection.

## Context
Inquiry-oriented courses across disciplines.

## Problem
Students need practice tackling messy challenges that lack obvious solutions.

## Forces
- Ambiguity of open-ended problems
- Necessity of collaboration and facilitator guidance

## Solution
Guide learners through iterative investigation:
1. Introduce a real or simulated problem scenario
2. Brainstorm what is known and unknown
3. Conduct research or mini-lessons on demand
4. Develop and test possible solutions
5. Present outcomes and reflect on the process

## Resulting Context
Learners integrate knowledge and teamwork skills while producing solutions.

## Problem Types
- **Well-Structured:** clear goals and single correct answer
- **Ill-Structured:** ambiguous data with multiple viable approaches
- **Wicked:** complex issues with no final solution and many stakeholders

## Examples
Health sciences, engineering design, teacher education, humanities projects
