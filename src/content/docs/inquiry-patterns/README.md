Inquiry-based learning (IBL) transforms students from passive recipients into active investigators. These patterns help learners pose questions, gather evidence and construct meaning through deliberate exploration.

## Classification
- **Pattern Type:** Exploration Pattern
- **Category:** Inquiry-Based Learning
- **Use Level:** Course, Module, Activity
- **Applicable Contexts:** Online, hybrid, face-to-face and competency-based education

## Pattern Types
- [Structured Inquiry](structured_inquiry.md)
- [Guided Inquiry](guided_inquiry.md)
- [Open Inquiry](open_inquiry.md)
- [Dialogic Inquiry](dialogic_inquiry.md)
- [Comparative Inquiry](comparative_inquiry.md)
- [Design-Driven Inquiry](design_driven_inquiry.md)

These patterns can progress from instructor-directed tasks toward open-ended investigations that cultivate research habits of mind.

## Key Pedagogical Components
- Align with Understanding by Design to build enduring inquiry habits.
- Use Universal Design for Learning so students engage, represent and express inquiry in multiple ways.
- Sequence from structured to open inquiry while modeling and fading instructor support.
