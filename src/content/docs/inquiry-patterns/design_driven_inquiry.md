description: ""
---

Investigation unfolds through iterative cycles of questioning, prototyping and testing.

## Context
Project-based courses merging research and design.

## Problem
Learners may generate solutions without evidence or iterate without clear inquiry.

## Forces
- Tension between exploration and building a viable product
- Need for continuous feedback from stakeholders

## Solution
Integrate design with inquiry cycles:
1. Frame a question or need
2. Prototype possible solutions
3. Test, gather feedback and refine

## Resulting Context
Students apply research mindsets while progressing toward functional prototypes.

## Examples
Design studios, engineering, social entrepreneurship
