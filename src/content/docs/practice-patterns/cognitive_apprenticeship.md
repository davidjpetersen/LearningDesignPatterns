Instructors model expert thinking, coach students through practice and gradually fade supports to develop independent skills.

## Context
Disciplines where tacit reasoning must become explicit.

## Problem
Novices cannot easily observe the mental processes of experts.

## Forces
- Need for modeling and scaffolding
- Gradual release of responsibility to learners

## Solution
Provide guided practice through stages:
1. Model the task with think-alouds
2. Guide learners as they practice
3. Provide scaffolds that fade over time
4. Encourage articulation and reflection
5. Let students attempt tasks independently

## Resulting Context
Learners internalize expert strategies and operate autonomously.

## Examples
Math proofs, scientific reasoning, design studios, clinical reasoning
