title: "Embodied & Experiential Practice"
description: ""
---

Learners engage in simulations or hands-on scenarios to experience tasks in realistic contexts.

## Context
Hands-on programs that mirror professional tasks.

## Problem
Passive study does not prepare learners for the realities of performance.

## Forces
- Need for physical or situational realism
- Risk management and safety

## Solution
Immerse learners in experiential activities:
1. Introduce the scenario or lab setup
2. Provide guided trial runs
3. Allow repeated practice with variations
4. Debrief and reflect on performance
5. Assess authentic task completion

## Resulting Context
Students gain muscle memory and situational awareness.

## Examples
Simulated patient care, maker labs, fieldwork, role-playing scenarios
