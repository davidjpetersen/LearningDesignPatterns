title: "Case-Based Patterns"
description: ""
---

Case-based patterns immerse learners in realistic scenarios where they practice professional judgement. They draw on experiential and situated learning theories, using stories that mirror how experts tackle ambiguous problems.

## Classification

- **Pattern Type:** Experience Pattern
- **Category:** Case-Based Learning
- **Use Level:** Course, Module, Activity
- **Applicable Contexts:** Online, hybrid and competency-based education

## Pattern Types

- [Decision Case](decision_case.md)
- [Evaluation Case](evaluation_case.md)
- [Problem-Diagnosis Case](problem_diagnosis_case.md)
- [Narrative Case](narrative_case.md)
- [Outlier Case](outlier_case.md)
- [Role-Play Case](role_play_case.md)
- [Longitudinal Case](longitudinal_case.md)

These patterns can be sequenced from guided to open-ended and return to earlier scenarios with new lenses over time.

## Design Principles
- Use authentic details with some ambiguity so learners sift the important facts from "noise."
- Provide scaffolds such as analysis frameworks and reflection prompts.
- Offer multiple ways to engage and respond to support UDL.

## Sequencing and Integration
- Start with directed cases, then progress toward open-ended or longitudinal formats.
- Revisit earlier cases through different perspectives (e.g., ethics or policy) to deepen understanding.

## Online and Hybrid Tips
- Share prompting questions beforehand to ensure preparation.
- During synchronous sessions, combine polls, breakout rooms and shared documents to keep discussion lively.
