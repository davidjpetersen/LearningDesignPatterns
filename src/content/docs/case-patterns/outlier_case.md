title: "Outlier Case"
description: ""
---

These cases intentionally feature atypical or extreme situations that violate usual patterns. They push learners to question assumptions and refine broader generalizations.

## Context
Courses exploring exceptions or unusual events.

## Problem
Learners often rely on common examples, missing edge cases that challenge assumptions.

## Forces
- Limited exposure to rare scenarios
- Difficulty generalizing from anomalies

## Solution
Present an outlier situation and analyze its implications.

## Resulting Context
Students see how exceptions can refine or contradict broader theories.

## Examples
Complex systems, ethics, social justice and emerging technologies
