title: "Design Critique Cycle"
description: ""
---

Students present early prototypes, receive structured feedback and revise until the design meets clear criteria.

## Context
Studios or project courses emphasizing iterative improvement.

## Problem
Designers often struggle to incorporate feedback systematically.

## Forces
- Balancing personal vision with peer or client expectations
- Preventing feedback sessions from becoming unfocused

## Solution
Facilitate a cycle of critique and revision:
1. Present Prototype or Concept
2. Receive Structured Feedback
3. Revise with Clear Criteria
4. Resubmit and Reflect on Evolution

## Resulting Context
Work improves through multiple iterations and learners build critique skills.

## Examples
Architecture, graphic design, instructional materials
