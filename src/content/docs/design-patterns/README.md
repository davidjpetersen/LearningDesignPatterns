Design-based learning (DBL) engages students in iterative, user-centered problem solving that turns theory into tangible solutions.

## Classification

- **Pattern Type:** Experience Pattern
- **Category:** Design-Based Learning
- **Use Level:** Course, Module, Project, Assignment
- **Applicable Contexts:** Undergraduate and graduate programs in hybrid, online and competency-based environments

## Pattern Types

- [Challenge Brief](challenge_brief.md)
- [Design Sprint](design_sprint.md)
- [Concept-to-Product Studio](concept_to_product_studio.md)
- [Human-Centered Redesign](human_centered_redesign.md)
- [Design Critique Cycle](design_critique_cycle.md)

These patterns emphasize iterative creation, peer feedback and reflection. They help learners transform conceptual understanding into innovative, user-focused outcomes.

## Key Pedagogical Components
- Integrate Understanding by Design with explicit transfer goals.
- Apply Universal Design for Learning for multiple modes of engagement and expression.
- Sequence from structured redesign tasks to open-ended innovation challenges.
