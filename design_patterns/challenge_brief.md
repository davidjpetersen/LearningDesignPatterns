# Challenge Brief

Students tackle a focused design prompt with clear constraints and user needs. They explore ideas, prototype quickly and iterate toward a workable solution.

## Context
Project-based design courses or workshops where rapid iteration is key.

## Problem
Learners must practice creating viable solutions under tight timelines while still meeting user expectations.

## Forces
- Creativity versus time and resource limits
- Aligning proposed solutions to authentic user needs

## Solution
A structured challenge brief guides teams through a rapid cycle:
1. Present the Challenge
2. Define Constraints
3. Frame the Problem
4. Explore Solutions
5. Create Prototypes
6. Iterate and Refine
7. Present and Reflect

## Resulting Context
Teams deliver a prototype and receive feedback, building confidence in the design process.

## Examples
Engineering, UX design, public health campaigns, instructional design
