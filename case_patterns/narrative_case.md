# Narrative / Exploratory Case

Also called an exploratory case, this format provides a rich story without a single correct answer. Students trace events, consider multiple perspectives and draw insights from complexity.

## Context
Learning environments emphasizing deep analysis over quick conclusions.

## Problem
Students need practice interpreting complex situations with no clear solution.

## Forces
- Ambiguity of motivations and outcomes
- Diverse perspectives from stakeholders

## Solution
Guide discussion around a rich narrative:
1. Present the Story
2. Explore Perspectives
3. Identify Key Factors
4. Discuss Insights
5. Summarize Takeaways

## Resulting Context
Learners appreciate nuance and can synthesize multiple viewpoints.

## Examples
History, social issues, and science courses where context and nuance matter.
