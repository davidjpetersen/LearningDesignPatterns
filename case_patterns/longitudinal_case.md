# Longitudinal Case

Learners follow a single case over time, often receiving new information in stages. This approach highlights the consequences of earlier decisions and develops process thinking.

## Context
Courses where understanding evolving situations is critical.

## Problem
Students rarely see how earlier actions impact later stages of a process.

## Forces
- Complexity of tracking changes over time
- Need for timely reflection after each stage

## Solution
Deliver the case in increments, prompting analysis and decision-making at each phase.

## Resulting Context
Learners connect cause and effect while refining long-term strategies.

## Examples
Medical education, project management and business strategy
