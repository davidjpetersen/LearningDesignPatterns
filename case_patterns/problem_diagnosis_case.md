# Problem-Diagnosis Case

Also called an analysis or issue case, learners sift through symptoms to diagnose the underlying cause of a complex problem and then propose solutions. Example: an engineering failure analysis or epidemiological investigation.

## Context
Programs where learners must isolate causes from complex data.

## Problem
When facing messy scenarios, students struggle to separate symptoms from root causes.

## Forces
- Data overload or missing information
- Pressure to recommend quick fixes

## Solution
Lead learners through a diagnostic sequence:
1. Read the Situation
2. Identify Symptoms
3. Diagnose the Root Cause
4. Propose Solutions
5. Justify Recommendations

## Resulting Context
Learners develop analytical rigor and confidence in troubleshooting.

## Examples
Engineering, medical diagnostics, IT troubleshooting and business analytics
