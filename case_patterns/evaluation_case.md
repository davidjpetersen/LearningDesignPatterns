# Evaluation Case

Learners critique past decisions or actions against objectives or standards. They judge what was done well and what could have been improved. Example: analyzing whether a merger delivered the promised results.

## Context
Courses teaching critical analysis of previous actions or results.

## Problem
Learners need a structured way to assess outcomes and suggest improvements.

## Forces
- Hindsight bias when reviewing decisions
- Availability of evidence or benchmarks

## Solution
Guide learners through systematic evaluation:
1. Review the situation and objectives
2. Analyze actions taken and results achieved
3. Compare outcomes with standards or benchmarks
4. Discuss what worked and what failed
5. Recommend improvements

## Resulting Context
Participants build skills in constructive critique and quality improvement.

## Examples
Quality assurance, program reviews, healthcare diagnostics and engineering
